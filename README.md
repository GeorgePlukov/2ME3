The design documents are located inside the eclipse project. The executables are in the folder called exes, they only work on windows operating systems (tested windows 8.1).

###Running the program for the first time
Often when running the game for the first time on your machine you will get a java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError. To fix this problem(using eclipse):

1) Open the project in the project explorer

2) Select JRE Systems Library, and click "Build Path" -> "Configure Build Path"

3) Select "Native library location" and click edit 

4) Navigate to the native folder(inside the project) and select your operating system.
